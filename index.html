<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p><i>What is your interest in IT?</i></p>
<p>My interest in IT is mostly around computer programming.  My major interest in IT began when I attended the computer program at the selective high school I attended.  However, the initial spark was when my father let me have his really old Tandy Windows 3.1 powered computer on which I taught myself QBasic.  My major IT experience began in high school where I learned C++ and some Java.  I also learned about computer hardware and repair along with gaining a CompTIA A+ certification.  After high school, I joined a computer science degree, however, I never finished it, and ended up going down a completely different path.  Now, my IT experience is primarily casual and mostly fueled by gaming and my current career.  My love of gaming inspired me to build my own computer which I still use to this day.  My current career, while not specifically IT, has allowed me to keep my analytical and computer skills sharp.</p>
<p><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT as it seems to have a well-rated IT program offered through flexible study.  Like many in this course, I already have a career that I prefer not to sacrifice while I go through a degree.  Through OpenUniversity, I am able to learn and gain a qualification while fitting it around my career as opposed to stopping everything and studying full time or asking my work for flexibility to study part time.  Also, RMIT seemed to be well regarded within Australia.</p>
<p><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></p>
<p>While I have a fair amount of knowledge, much of it is centred around programming, and my other knowledge is fairly broad in nature.  During my studies, I mainly expect to learn more about information technology in-depth, especially around subjects I do not know as much about such as databases, systems administration, and building IT systems.  I also expect to learn quite a bit more in terms of software design and more advanced programming concepts.</p>
