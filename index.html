<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p><i>What is your interest in IT?</i></p>
<p>I am interested in IT as I have a personality that enjoys solving challenging problems and helping people.</br>
My first experience with IT was when I was given an Apple 2+ computer for christmas which I used for gaming and programming.</br>
During my schooling teachers would ask me for assistance with their computers.</br>
After School I did a diploma in Software Development and gained a job as a junior programmer.</br>
From there I moved into network support and help desk then onto managing larger networks and systems.</p>
<p><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></p>
<p>My choice of RMIT for doing this degree was based on brand recognition.</br>
I have worked with people in the past who have done their degree at RMIT and have spoken very highly of the course and the institution.</p>
<p><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></p>
<p>By completing this degree I am expecting to learn best practice theory and fill in my missing skills and knowledge to make me a better IT professional.</br>This has also been a goal of mine since starting in IT.</p>

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40545990?type=standout#searchRequestToken=f6bd19d3-13bd-4f6c-a22f-b1b5e49954d6" target="_top">Link to the Job</a></td>
</p>
<p><strong>Position Description</strong></br>
The job as described in the advertisement is for an IT manager who is proactive and able to cover all levels of service required.</br>
Reading the ideal candidate description conveys that they are looking for an all rounder who is able to operate with minimal assistance and is capable of building the systems which are required as they currently donâ€™t exist.</br>
This makes the job very attractive for me as I enjoy operating in a fluid and dynamic environment where you have to be capable and actively building solutions.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Skills and Experience required</strong></br>
This job is looking for a person with the ability to work without supervision and interact with management and stakeholders on a professional level with the skills to influence both groups.</br>
There is no mention of a formal qualification which implies that the company is looking for someone with more practical experience such as Office 365 and an established history of working in a similar role.</br>
