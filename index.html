<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p><i>What is your interest in IT?</i></p>
<p>I am interested in IT as I have a personality that enjoys solving challenging problems and helping people.</br>
My first experience with IT was when I was given an Apple 2+ computer for christmas which I used for gaming and programming.</br>
During my schooling teachers would ask me for assistance with their computers.</br>
After School I did a diploma in Software Development and gained a job as a junior programmer.</br>
From there I moved into network support and help desk then onto managing larger networks and systems.</p>
<p><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></p>
<p>My choice of RMIT for doing this degree was based on brand recognition.</br>
I have worked with people in the past who have done their degree at RMIT and have spoken very highly of the course and the institution.</p>
<p><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></p>
<p>By completing this degree I am expecting to learn best practice theory and fill in my missing skills and knowledge to make me a better IT professional.</br>This has also been a goal of mine since starting in IT.</p>
