<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<p><i>What is your interest in IT?</i></p>
<p>I am interested in IT as I have a personality that enjoys solving challenging problems and helping people.</br>
My first experience with IT was when I was given an Apple 2+ computer for christmas which I used for gaming and programming.</br>
During my schooling teachers would ask me for assistance with their computers.</br>
After School I did a diploma in Software Development and gained a job as a junior programmer.</br>
From there I moved into network support and help desk then onto managing larger networks and systems.</p>
<p><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></p>
<p>My choice of RMIT for doing this degree was based on brand recognition.</br>
I have worked with people in the past who have done their degree at RMIT and have spoken very highly of the course and the institution.</p>
<p><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></p>
<p>By completing this degree I am expecting to learn best practice theory and fill in my missing skills and knowledge to make me a better IT professional.</br>This has also been a goal of mine since starting in IT.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Position Description</strong></br>
The job as described in the advertisement is for an IT manager who is proactive and able to cover all levels of service required.</br>
Reading the ideal candidate description conveys that they are looking for an all rounder who is able to operate with minimal assistance and is capable of building the systems which are required as they currently don’t exist.</br>
This makes the job very attractive for me as I enjoy operating in a fluid and dynamic environment where you have to be capable and actively building solutions.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Skills and Experience required</strong></br>
This job is looking for a person with the ability to work without supervision and interact with management and stakeholders on a professional level with the skills to influence both groups.</br>
There is no mention of a formal qualification which implies that the company is looking for someone with more practical experience such as Office 365 and an established history of working in a similar role.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Skills and Experience I have</strong></br>
My thirty years of experience in the IT industry means that I have covered all of the minimum requirements and the experience required.</br>
I have operated at a level reporting to CEO's, boards and to internal and external stakeholders for orgisations from 5 to 20,000 employees.</br>
My best fit to the job requirements is in the Ideal candidate section where I have experience with building IT systems and creating solutions for businesses without an already established IT department or infrastructure.</br>
</br>
<p><strong>Plan for obtaining additional Skils</strong></br>
While I already have the experience and skills for the job, I believe that the addition of a degree would ensure that my application would be moved to above any similar qualified and experienced applicant who doesn’t have a degree.

<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</strong></br>
These test are an interesting perspective on the various attributes that make up a person and how they can be used to stregthen or weaken teams.
</br>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></br>
Given that all teams are dynamic and that we should all be seeking to achieve the same and best reult then these results would be most useful prior to picking the team.</br>
They may be useful in gaining insight into how best to deal with conflict.</br> 
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></br>
While these results are important in forming a team the skils and experience that each member brings to the team is much more important.
These would be more useful if you hed multiple team members with similar skills and experienc</br>
Then you could use these tests to better fit the team members to the teams.</br>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<p>A scheduling assistant for a retail shop</br>
</br>
<strong>Overview</strong></br>
A website, portal and/or an app which would enable a store manager to specify the opening hours, shift times and staffing levels for the store with particular focus on any skill requirements of staff for each shift (Cook, Prep, Shift Manager).</br>
The shift would be able to be created and managed graphically by the manager with staff notified of their shifts and able to accept, swap or decline shifts based on their availability.</br>
</br>
<strong>Motivation</strong></br>
Most retail stores struggle with ensuring that their staff know what shifts they are working and ensuring that the right people with the right skills are scheduled for each shift.</br>
A very large amount of the management of any retail store and in particular a food store is spent creating and managing shifts and staff.</br>
</br>
<strong>Description</strong></br>
A website which will allow owners, managers and shift managers to manage their staff and their shift staffing levels to ensure that there are the right number of people with the right skills allocated to each shift.</br>
The website should be able to track the experience of staff and managers, their skills and qualifications and produce reports that can be used either directly or manually to update payroll systems and costings.</br>
</br>
Store Managers</br>
The manager of a store would be able to control the opening hours including holidays, staffing hours, shift numbers, shift budgets and shift staffing levels for the store.</br>
An overview of the future staffing and costings for each shift would enable balancing of shift costs against anticipated store turnover with the manager able to simply budget using a graphical drag and drop or automated system to create the shifts.</br>
If the store manager allows it then the shift managers could be allocated the ability to manage their shifts directly allowing them to do the shift building and budgeting.</br>
Store managers would also create staff and promote staff to shift managers, cooks and authorise any skills and qualifications unless they have alloced this to shift managers.</br> 
</br>
Shift Managers</br>
The manager of a particular shift would be able to drag and drop staffing to ensure a balanced shift taking into account staffing levels, skill requirements and financial budgeting of the shift.</br>
The shift manager would finalise their shift and the store manager would then be able to either approve or have the shift automatically approved. When a shift is completed the shift manager may make any notes regarding the shift and possibly add turnover totals to the shift before finalising the shift where the staff experience would be updated and the store manager sent an update of the shift.</br>
Shift Managers would be able to mix and match staffing to ensure that not only is there enough staff but also to spread the experience loading.</br>
This will ensure there is no accidental all inexperienced cook placed on a shift and that a trainee in one skill is placed with the best experienced staff available.</br>   
</br>
Staff</br>
Each staff member would be created by a store of shift manager and then manage their own contact details and information such as holidays, skills, qualifications and availability with their manager able to review and authorise relevant details.</br>
The staff member would receive notification of any shifts they have been allocated to and approve or decline the shift based on their availability.</br>
The staff members would be able to give up a shift to a similarly skilled and qualified other staff member with the shift manager and or store owner, manager updated about the change and give the right to accept or veto.</br>
Staff would be sent push reminders regarding their shift allocation when the shift is finalised and a specific period of time prior to the start of their shift.</br>
Staff would be able to make their shift available based on a private one to one offer to their friend or friends or put their shift up for whomever wants it.</br>
Maybe on a first come first served or on a manager picks from available bidders option.</br>
 </br>
<strong>Tools & Tech</strong></br>
A database stored in the cloud and integrated with a website used as a portal would be the minimum requirements of this system. My preference would be an HTML5 website which could display on a monitor, tablet or mobile with the format being changed to reflect the available real estate. The security would have to be 2 factor with either sms or email used to verify changes made at all levels. 
</br></br>
<strong>Skills required</strong></br>
Relational database development skills would be necessary with SQL being a leading contender for the database.</br>
HTML5 and PHP skills would be the minimum for the web development with probable scripting needed to make the interactivity work.</br>
</br>
<strong>Outcome</strong></br>
Revolutionising the the currently manual and basically crappy shift and store staffing of retail food businesses would allow free up the time of managers and allow them to focus on the management of their store rather than micro managing their staff.</br>
The previous staff history record for a new employee would also ensure that the experience and skills learnt in one store would transfer to a new employee.</br>
